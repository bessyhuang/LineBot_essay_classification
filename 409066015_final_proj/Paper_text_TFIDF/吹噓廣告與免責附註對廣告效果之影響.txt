吹噓廣告與免責附註對廣告效果之影響
The effects of puffery and disclaimer footnotes on advertising effect
不實廣告、吹噓廣告、免責附註、附註行銷、同化/對比理論

本研究目的為探討吹噓廣告與免責附註對消費者之廣告相信程度、產品信念、知覺價值與購買意願之影響。過去相關文獻顯示，吹噓廣告是否會受到消費者採信共有兩種相反的看法，本研究為釐清此爭議，除了選擇三項不同商品做為實驗設計的廣告產品，以求得實驗結果一般化之外，更輔以同化/對比理論來做為探討的基礎。至於免責附註的部份，本研究則分別對廣告中是否具備免責附註以及具備何種免責附註來進行討論。本研究發現，在一般消費者之中，吹噓程度越高的廣告，其給予消費者的廣告效果即越差。然而，當消費者以涉入程度分類之後，高涉入的消費者同樣具備上述情況，而低涉入的消費者則否，此為本研究導入同化/對比理論所欲說明之現象。而在免責附註方面，本研究也發現當廣告中具備免責附註，特別是資訊型免責附註時，都能有效地部份提昇廣告效果。
The purpose of this study is to discuss how advertising effect, including advertising believability, product belief, perceived value and purchase intention would be influenced by puffery and disclaimer footnotes in advertising. According to literature, it shows two contrast points of view on the issue of whether consumers would believe in the puffery advertisement. In order to clarify the dispute, this study not only chooses three kinds of product to generalize the result, but also take advantage of assimilation-contrast theory to be the base of discussion. As for the disclaimer footnotes, the appearance as well as the type will also be examined in the study.The result indicates that the more puffy advertisement is, the less advertising effect it brings to the general consumers. Nevertheless, merely the high involved consumers have the same effect as above when those consumers are classified by the degree of involvement. And that is the phenomenon which assimilation-contrast theory would be used to describe in this research. In the aspect of disclaimer footnotes, this study also discover the appearance of disclaimer footnotes in the advertisement, especially the informational one would effectively raise the advertising effect in part.
