子女氣質、母親後設情緒理念與子女依附傾向的相關性研究
The relationship among children's temperament、maternal meta-emotion philosophy and children's attachment inclination
後設情緒理念、親子關係、子女氣質、依附傾向

本研究探討子女氣質、母親後設情緒理念與子女依附傾向的關連性。研究樣本為546對國小五年級、六年級的學童與母親。研究結果發現，不同性別的子女氣質、母親後設情緒理念與子女依附傾向無顯著差異。在檢視三種負向情緒性氣質：焦慮困擾、害怕及生氣的結果後發現，三種情緒性氣質均與依附有顯著的關聯。母親教導型、摒除型及失控型三種後設情緒理念均與依附傾向有顯著關聯，但不干涉型情緒理念則與依附傾向無顯著相關。接著從路徑分析結果發現，除了子女氣質對子女依附傾向有顯著的直接影響效果之外，子女氣質也會透過母親後設情緒理念的間接影響，再影響到子女依附傾向。研究結果建議，父母必須重視子女天生的氣質，可採用情緒教導型理念來指導子女情緒反應、幫助子女面對情緒困擾，在家庭系統的雙向影響下，經由家庭正向的情緒互動模式來建立親子間安全的依附關係。
The aim of this study is to understand the relationship among children's temperament、maternal meta-emotion philosophy and children's attachment inclination.546 fifth and Sixth graders and their mothers are the sample of this study. According to the finding, it was found that there were no gender differences for children's temperament、maternal meta-emotion philosophy and children's attachment inclination.For negative emotional temperament(anxiety、fear and angry), they were significantly related to attachment. The three meta–emotion philosophy：emotion-coaching、emotion-dismissing、and emotion-dysfunction were significantly related to attachment inclination. However, emotion-noninvolvement philosophy was not related to attachment inclination significantly.According to the result of path analysis，it was found that children's temperament had direct effect on attachment inclination.Children's temperament also had indirect effect on attachment inclination through maternal meta-emotion philosophy.The study suggests that parents should understand children’s temperament first, and use emotion-coaching philosophy to interact with their children. Secure attachment can then be built through positive parent-child interaction.
