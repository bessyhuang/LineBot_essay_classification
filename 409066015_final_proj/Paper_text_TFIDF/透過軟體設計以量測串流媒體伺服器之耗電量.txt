透過軟體設計以量測串流媒體伺服器之耗電量
Measurement by the Software Design for the Power Consumption of Streaming Media Servers
串流媒體、軟體估測
降低電腦功率消耗是重要的研究；本篇論文提出利用偵測串流媒體伺服器(Streaming Media Server)的CPU使用率(Utilization)與實際耗能，並利用數學方法來導出兩者間的關聯性；實驗中發現當伺服器(Server)服務率提高時，CPU使用率會隨著提高，此時連同電腦整體系統的耗能也會提高，其關係呈現一個指數 (Exponential)的關聯，因此根據此關係來設計一軟體模組以對伺服器進行耗能估測。基於我們實驗結果，伺服器的功率估測可以不必透過AC功率分析儀(AC Power Meter)就可得知電腦的功率消耗多少，未來除了可以應用於遠端功率估測外，甚至還可以應用於一般的家用個人電腦，利用軟體直接估測功率消耗，這樣的方法可以讓使用者立即知道自己的電腦使用了多久和總共須負擔多少的功率成本，進一步讓每部電腦耗電得以估計，以此再加強電腦電源管理後而可達節能之目的。
The power consumption of the streaming media server can be obtained in real time by the virtual instrumentation software module described in this paper without an additional hardware meter. From the data gathered from our experiment, we conclude that the measurement of the power consumption of the streaming media server depends on the CPU utilization dynamically and with some system operation parameters. We form a model to represent the power consumption with respect to the CPU utilization. By using the software method based on this model, users can measure of the power consumption the PC at any time even remotely through the Internet. Once the required measurements are made, the acquired data can be immediately transferred back to the monitor server in order that the measured data can be analyzed in more detail. To facilitate the measurement process, we also design a suitable graphic user interface. Our method has been tested through a comparison with the measurement results by means of a power meter.
