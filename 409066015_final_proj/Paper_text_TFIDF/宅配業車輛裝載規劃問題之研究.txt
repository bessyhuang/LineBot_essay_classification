宅配業車輛裝載規劃問題之研究
The Research of Vehicle Loading Problem on Home Delivery
宅配業、容器裝載問題、模擬退火法
近幾年來，宅配市場蓬勃發展，目前除了中華郵政（郵局）之外，許多國內企業相繼投入宅配市場，而傳統貨運公司也開始亦提供宅配服務。而本研究主要是針對宅配業貨物之車輛裝載規劃問題進行探討，為一三維容器裝載器問題（Three-Dimensional Container Loading Problem，3DCLP），並考量宅配業的作業特性－多配送點、配送順序性、小型貨物等特性下，裝載貨物若未依先進後出的原則裝載，則作業員的卸貨時間將會大幅提高；而若完全依照先進後出的原則，依序裝載貨物，則會有空間利用率不佳的情形發生，因此本研究針對此宅配業貨物裝載問題（3DCLP on Home Delivery），建構數學模式並結合啟發式演算法求解，期能在空間利用率及配送便利性之間求得一均衡點。經求解結果顯示，此模式求解結果在單一配送點平均卸次數5次以下，明顯較一般模擬退火法求解3DCLP問題佳，而本研究設計之SA雖會比一般SA降低約3%的空間使用率，卻可降低7%阻礙卸貨率，符合於宅配業作業特性，應可供實務參考或後續進一步研究。
With the growth of home delivery market in recent years, there are more and more industries successively entering into the market and some of traditional transportation corporations also start to provide home delivery service. In this research we mainly focus on the study on vehicle loading problem of home delivery service, which is a three-dimensional container loading problem with taking the characteristics of home delivery service into account, those are multiple distribution spot, sequential distribution and small size goods.For vehicle loading operation, if we pack the cargo with first-in-last-out sequence, the usage of container may be low. Otherwise, if we don’t pack the cargo with such a sequence, the unloading time may be increased. Therefore, our research is to purpose the mathematics model of 3D Container loading problem with home delivery based on simulated annealing to balance the usage of container and the convenience of unloading operation.The result reveals that our heuristic algorithm could be more efficient over the traditional simulated annealing under the average unloading goods of 5. And this algorithm will lower the usage of container by 3%, but could also decrease 7% percentage of the goods which hinder the unloading operation. That is fit in with the characteristic of home delivery service, and could be applied to the practice and further research.
