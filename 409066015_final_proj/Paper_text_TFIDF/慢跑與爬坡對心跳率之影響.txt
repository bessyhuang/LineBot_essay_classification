慢跑與爬坡對心跳率之影響
The Influence of Heart Rate on Jogging and Hill Walking
心跳率、慢跑、著地時間
本研究的主要目的是找出同等負荷下之跑走運動—慢跑與爬坡，兩種不同坡度之運動—兩者分別對心跳率之影響，並量測運動過程中，地面反作用力的變化之狀況；進而了解何者可以較快速達到最佳運動效果。本研究共有76位大學生自願參與，有效取樣為男生44名（年齡22.61±1.50歲、身高174.57±6.21公分、體重74.39±11.25公斤）、女生20名（年齡22.60±0.99歲、身高161.35±5.72公分、體重51.55±5.96公斤）。參與者帶上無線心跳測量錶（Polar heart rate monitor）、在裝有測力板並可以調整坡度的跑步機（Gaitway）上，分別進行坡度走路及平面慢跑，並同時收集其的心跳率及地面反作用力。採用成對樣本t-test對參與者的心跳率值、著地時間進行統計分析（α=.05），得知參與者是否有效達到快速運動效果。本研究結果顯示，爬坡走路運動方式比平面慢跑更有利於作為有氧運動。走路運動時間持續越久，不僅消耗更多能量，更可以提升運動者之心跳率達到運動效果。因此本研究建議想要以跑走運動來改善心肺功能、或是運用運動效果來達到體重控制者，可以安排爬坡走路或是從事爬山健行運動來作為更有效率的運動方式。
The main purpose of this study is to compare the influence of heart rates between jogging and climbing. The better way to achieve the effective exercise effect was found in this study by comparing the heart rates while jogging on the zero-slope ground and climbing.There were 76 collegiate students volunteering to participate in this study; the available samples were 44 males (age 22.61±1.50 years old, height 174.57±6.21cm, weight 11.25±74.39 kg), and 20 females (age 22.60±0.99 years old, height 5.72±161.35 cm, weight 5.96±51.55 kg). Participants, wearing Polar heart rate monitor, jogged or climbed on the Gaitway treadmill with 2 force plates; in the meanwhile, their heart rates and ground contact time were measured. Paired sample t-test (=.05) was used to compare participants’ heart rates and the ground contact time between jogging and climbing, and then to know whether the participants achieved the effective exercise. The result showed that climbing is more effective to achieve the aerobics than jogging. The longer time of climbing, not only more calories consumed, but also more effective to help athletes to raise their heart rates to reach the aerobics.This study suggested that walking on the gradient ground or climbing is a better way to improve the ability of Cardiovascular Endurance and to maintain the ideal weight than jogging on zero-slop ground. Moreover, climbing is also an ideal way to burn calories.
