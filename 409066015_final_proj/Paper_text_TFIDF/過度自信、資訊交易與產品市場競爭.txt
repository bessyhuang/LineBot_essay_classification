近年來有些文獻傾向從整合性的觀點來探討公司的各種決策，譬如韓千山(2004)即曾探討經理人內線交易對產品市場競爭之影響。經理人身為公司管理者且又是內部人的雙重角色，使得結合股市內線交易與產出策略的議題相當有趣。本文除了延續內線交易與產品市場的研究外，另將重心放在經理人的行為設定上。近年來有許多的研究顯示過度自信是人類與生俱來的特質，而這種行為特徵在某些專業程度越高的行業中尤其明顯，公司的經理人即是符合此種條件的最好例子。因此本文透過雙市場模型的設定，將過度自信納入經理人行為之中，並分析過度自信經理人與其他市場參與人在產出策略與股票交易的行為特徵。最後本文發現過度自信經理人相對於理性經理人在股票市場的交易數量較多，但在產品市場的產量則不必然較多，產量的多寡取決於市場條件。
In recent years, there are some papers try to discuss corporate strategies with integrated point of view. For example, Han, Chian-Shan (2004) states that there are important linkages between product market and insider trading. Corporate manager is not only the management but also insider of a company. This makes the issues that combine insider trading and product market competition very interesting. This paper continues the former research about insider trading and product market competition but put more weight on manager’s behavior. That’s because lots of surveys revealed overconfidence is an attribute of human being, and as the degree of job professionalism increase the tendency of overconfidence become more apparent. Obviously, a corporate manager will fit such kind of description. Therefore, through the setting of model, this paper shows how an overconfident manager acts in the stock market and product market. Finally, we bring up the idea that overconfident manager will trade more volumes in the stock market than rational manager. However, there is no necessity he will produce more in the product market. The quantity he produces depends on the market condition.
