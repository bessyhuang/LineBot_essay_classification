小兒白血病、地理資訊系統、極低頻磁場、流行病學、發生率、波以松迴歸、相對危險性
背景與目的：西元2001年6月，聯合國世界衛生組織所屬國際癌症研究總署綜合流行病學研究與動物實驗之科學研究證據，在研究報告中指出：對於15歲以下兒童的白血病而言，4毫高斯（mili–Gauss；mG）以上的極低頻磁場暴露是一個可能的致癌物質。進行環境極低頻磁場的暴露評估雖然可以利用儀器進行直接量測，但因為使用大量儀器所需成本過高以及儀器無法進行較長時間之連續量測，因此許多流行病學研究會利用一些間接測量的方法進行環境評估。本研究嘗試利用地理資訊系統估計台灣地區各鄉鎮市區高壓輸電線密度，並結合台灣地區癌症發生登記檔，探討環境極低頻磁場暴露與15歲以下兒童癌症發生率之相關性。材料與方法：本研究利用2002年版地理資訊系統分析評估台灣地區359個鄉鎮市區範圍內高壓輸電線密度，計算各鄉鎮市區鄰近高壓輸電線兩側100公尺範圍區域佔總面積之百分比，並將此百分比按四分位數區分為高、中、低與極低四個暴露等級進行比較；此外，本研究也比較居住於暴露面積≧90百分位數與居住於未有暴露面積之研究對象其癌症發生率之差異；以及比較兒童居住於境內有國民中小學校園遭高壓輸電線跨越之鄉鎮市區，與未有此暴露狀況兒童之癌症發生率。小兒癌症發生資料則是擷取自1991–1997年之癌症登記資料，其中0–14歲全癌症與小兒白血病之個案數分別有3,684與1,122人；統計方法為，以台灣整體發生率為參考，計算暴露鄉鎮市區之年代、年齡及性別標準化發生比，以及利用波以松迴歸模式控制年齡、性別、年代別及都市化程度後計算暴露鄉鎮市區之小兒癌症相對危險性。結果：高暴露組（≧75th百分位數）、中暴露組（≧50th～＜75th百分位數）及低暴露組（＞25th～＜50th百分位數）兒童無論在全癌症及小兒白血病部份之標準化發生比，都較極低暴露組（≦25th百分位數）略高；而以複迴歸分析控制年代、性別、年齡及都市化程度等干擾因子後，在全癌症部份，高暴露組、中暴露組及低暴露組發生全癌症的危險性皆高於極低暴露組，調整後的發生率比（rate ratio；RR）分別為1.11（95％CI＝0.97–1.26）、1.10（95％CI＝0.96–1.25）及1.03（95％CI＝0.89–1.18），但均未達到統計上之顯著差異；在小兒白血病的部分，高暴露組、中暴露組及低暴露組發生小兒白血病的危險性皆高於極低暴露組，調整後的RR分別為1.07（95％CI＝0.84–1.36）、1.17（95％CI＝0.92–1.49）、1.15（95％CI＝0.89–1.48），亦皆未達統計上之顯著差異。在針對兒童全癌症暴露分組的RR值作線性趨勢檢定分析時發現，各組之RR值並無顯著的線性劑量效應關係存在（p＝0.077），而小兒白血病各組之RR值亦未有顯著的劑量效應關係存在（p＝0.859）；此外，居住於暴露等級≧90百分位數鄉鎮市區之兒童，本研究也未發現其發生全癌症（調整後RR＝1.26，95％CI＝1.00–1.60）及小兒白血病（調整後RR＝1.46，95％CI＝0.91–2.32）相對危險性顯著高於居住於未有暴露鄉鎮市區之兒童，居住區域內有國民中小學校園遭高壓輸電線跨越鄉鎮市區之兒童其全癌症（調整後RR＝1.05，95％CI＝0.98–1.13）及小兒白血病（調整後RR＝0.99，95％CI＝0.86–1.13）發生率也未高於對照組兒童。結論：本研究利用三種暴露評估方式界定台灣地區鄉鎮市區極低頻磁場之暴露狀況，但均未發現居住於較高磁場暴露之鄉鎮市區之兒童其小兒癌症及白血病有顯著增加的現象，由於市售地理資訊系統目前僅能提供高壓輸電線之圖層資料，其他環境中的電力設施（如變電所、配電線及變電箱等）均未能於本研究中加以評估其對磁場強度之貢獻，因此可能存在有潛在的訊息偏差問題。關鍵詞：小兒白血病、地理資訊系統、極低頻磁場、流行病學、發生率、波以松迴歸、相對危險性
Background and Objectives In June, 2001, the International Agency for Research on cancer affiliated with the World Health Organization reviewed scientific evidence from both epidemiological and animal studies and concluded that exposure to extremely-low-frequency magnetic field (ELF) greater than 4 mili–Gauss (mG) is a possible cause of childhood leukemia. Although on-site measurement, using instrument, can be performed to obtain direct information on ELF exposure, many epidemiological studies still used indirect exposure measures for exposure assessment mainly due to the cost consideration. This study attempts to use the geographic information system (GIS) for calculating high-tension transmission lines density in all townships around the country. Together with cancer incidence data, this study aimed to investigate the association between environmental exposure to ELF indicated by transmission line density and the risk of cancer among children aged less than 15.Materials and Methods This study used the 2002 version GIS to analyze the high-tension transmission lines density for all 359 townships in Taiwan; and to calculate the percentage in area within 100 meters (m) on either side of the power lines. Comparisons were made between children in each percentage exposure quartiles; as well as between the children living in townships with percentage exposure ≧90th percentile and those living in areas with a percentage exposure of zero. Additionally, we also compared incidence rate of childhood cancer between children in townships with at least one elementary or junior high school passed over by high-tension transmission lines and those who didn’t have such exposure. The incidence data on childhood cancer were retrieved from the 1991 to 1997 cancer registration. The number of incidence for all cancer and childhood leukemia was 3,684 and 1,122, respectively among children aged 0-14 years. The statistical analyses included calculation of calendar–, age–, and sex–standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for the study subjects living in townships with different exposure classifications with reference to the overall incidence rate of Taiwan. We also used Poisson regression model adjusted for age, sex, calendar year, and level of urbanization, to calculate the rate ratio (RR) of childhood cancer in relation to elevated exposures.Results Study subjects in the three higher exposure quartiles (i.e., ≧75th, ≧50th～＜75th, and ＞25th～＜50th) had higher SIRs of all cancer and childhood leukemia than those in the lowest quartile (i.e., <25th). Multivariate regression analysis adjusted for calendar year, sex, age, and level of urbanization showed that as compared to children with the lowest exposure (<25th), children with exposure of ≧75th, ≧50th～＜75th, and ＞25th～＜50th all had non-significantly increased rate ratio (RR) of 1.11 (95％CI＝0.97–1.26), 1.10 (95％CI＝0.96–1.25), and 1.03 (95％CI＝0.89–1.18), respectively. The corresponding figures for childhood leukemia were 1.07 (95％CI＝0.84–1.36), 1.17 (95％CI＝0.92–1.49), and 1.15 (95％CI＝0.89–1.48). Again, these relative risk estimates were also non-significant statistically. Results from trend analyses showed that there was no significant dose gradient between level of exposure and RR of all cancer (p=0.077) and RR of childhood leukemia (p=0.859). Additionally, comparison between children with percentage exposure ≧90th and unexposed children also suggested no significantly increased risk of all cancer (RR=1.26, 95 CI=1.00-1.60) and childhood leukemia (RR=1.46, 95% CI=0.91-2.32). Children living in townships with campuses passed by high-tension transmission lines also did not show significantly increased risks of all cancer (RR=1.05, 95% CI=0.98-1.13) and childhood leukemia (RR=0.99, 95% CI=0.86-1.13).Conclusion By using three different strategies in determining ELF exposure level of townships in Taiwan, this study did not disclose any significantly increased risk of childhood leukemia in townships with elevated exposure to ELF. Results from the current analysis are subject to potential information bias due to the fact that the GIS includes only high-tension transmission lines and did not include the information on other environmental source of ELF such as substation, transmission lines, and transformers.Keywords childhood leukemia, geographic information system, extremely-low-frequency magnetic field, epidemiology, incidence rate, Poisson regression, relative risk.
