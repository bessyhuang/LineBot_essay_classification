信用衍生性金融工具之探討
A Study of Credit Derivatives—Terms and Contractual Arrangements
信用衍生性金融工具、信用違約交換、信用連結債券、合成式擔保債務憑證

1997年亞洲金融風暴以及2000年後，美國許多知名企業紛紛傳出會計醜聞，市場越來越重視信用風險，加上2007年要實施的新版巴塞爾資本協定，使得信用衍生性金融工具的市場規模越來越大。在全球金融市場的趨勢帶動下，國內的信用衍生性金融工具的市場也逐步在成長，在此同時，本文希望透過實務的信用衍生性商品契約條款，針對商品的設計、商品的訂價來做探討。本研究一共蒐集了四個商品契約：信用違約交換（CDS）、信用連結債券（CLN）以及兩個合成式CDO，從契約內容、交易架構、商品的訂價等方面去做介紹與探討。在商品設計上，快速的金融創新使得商品越來越多樣化；訂價方面，傳統的評價模型計算過於複雜，模型的發展也跟不上金融創新的速度，市場應該有更適合的訂價方式。
The Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the well-publicized scandals of many famous companies since 2000 led the market to focus on the credit risk. In addition, Basel II is to be implemented from the beginning of 2007; this will also accelerate the growth in the market for credit derivatives products. Under the influence of the global market trend, the domestic market for credit derivatives in Taiwan will be heating up soon. To facilitate the development of local credit derivatives market, this study analyzes the contractual terms and arrangements of four real-world credit derivatives products to provide the essential insight of product design and marketing strategies. The four contracts investigated are a credit default swap (CDS), a credit linked note (CLN) and two Synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). We discuss the content, transaction structures and pricing methodology of these contracts.Our conclusions are as follows1.About the design Under the force of financial innovation, credit derivatives have evolved with great depth and diversity, and are often highly leveraged in credit-risk transferring.2.About the pricing The increasing complexity of the pricing models make their application become much more burdensome and errors prone, there is an urgent need to development a variety of related markets for components and to have prices derived from market transactions.
