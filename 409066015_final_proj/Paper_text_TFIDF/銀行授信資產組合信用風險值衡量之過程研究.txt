銀行授信資產組合信用風險值衡量之過程研究
A process research on Credit VaR measurement of Bank’s loan asset portfolios
信用風險值、新巴塞爾資本協定
本研究的目的，希望透過分析Morgan（1997） Credit Metrics 衡量投資組合信用風險值的過程，參酌國內實際的狀況，找出衡量銀行授信資產組合信用風險值的方法和模式，使銀行能具備初步的風險值觀念來計算信用風險。此外，本研究另以CDS(credit default swaps，信用違約交換)為例，將CDS加入授信資產組合的風險衡量流程中，說明如何利用信用衍生性金融商品來管理信用風險，達到風險控制的目標，期望能有效地幫助銀行做出符合信用風險管理及資本效益最佳的決策。本研究主要的結論如下：一、  若假設授信資產組合價值分配為常態，銀行可能會低估了所面臨的信用風險值。二、  銀行應該以壓力測試的概念選取最大的授信資產組合計算信用風險值，做最保守的狀況估計。三、  加入信用衍生性商品CDS後可降低個別授信資產之信用風險值。四、  以新巴塞爾資本協定資本計提率8%計算之預期損失明顯低於Credit Metric 模型之信用風險值，可能原因除Credit Metric 模型另外考量了授信資產被降等的風險外，授信資產組合內各資產的相關性亦是影響的可能因素。
The object of this study applies Credit Metrics  model (Morgan, 1997) to find the method and model of Credit VaR of bank’s loan assets portfolio by referring Taiwan’s bank actual situation asset portfolios. This result not only provides a basic concept of Credit VaR. Moreover, this study uses CDS as an example. Including CDS into the risk management process of loan assets portfolio. Indicating how derivatives can manage credit risk in order to reach the goal of risk control and how derivatives can help banks making the best decision under risk management and capital efficiency consideration.The conclusion of this study Summarized as follows1.  If the loan asset value is normal distribution, banks may underestimate the Credit VaR , which they are going to face.2.  Bank should choose the largest loan asset portfolio Credit VaR  under stress test concept to be the most conservative estimation.3.  Including CDS can reduce each loan asset of Credit VaR.4.  The expecting loss calculated by new Basel accord is obviously lower than Credit VaR calculated by Credit Metric  model. There might have two reasons of this result (1) The downgrade risk of loan assets is considered in Credit Metrics  model (2) The correlation between assets.
