影響工作滿意度因素之研究－以某軍種聘雇人員為例
The Study of the Job Satisfaction of Contract Employees in Certain Service Branch
滿意度、聘雇人員、RIDIT、邏吉斯模型、因素分析

本研究以問卷抽樣調查某軍種聘雇人員工作滿意之情況，藉以深入了解影響聘雇人員工作滿意之因素。經蒐整相關文獻，以人格特質、主官領導行為、工作特性及個人屬性探討聘雇人員之工作滿意情形。研析發現，影響聘雇人員工作滿意（滿意或不滿意）的因素，主要為年齡、性別、工作特性及領導行為。而受訪聘雇人員對同事相處、工作與能力相符及工作穩定性滿意度最高；對福利、退休及進修制度的滿意度最差。本研究據以研擬建議事項如后：人事及相關單位應研擬相關配套措施，提供聘雇人員短期在職訓練員額、分派業務應適度考量，另鼓勵單位主官應儘量以「鼓勵」代替「責難」，以增進員工向心力，進而提升其工作滿意度。
The study was conducted to determine the job satisfaction of contract employees in certain service branch through sampling survey questionnaires so as to learn more about factors influencing job satisfaction of contract employees. Based on relevant documents and references, the study adopted personality traits, leadership styles of commanders, job characteristics as well as personal attributes to analyze job satisfaction of contract employees.The study found that major factors influencing job satisfaction (satisfied or unsatisfied) of contract employees are age, gender, job characteristics, and leadership behaviors. The interviewed contract employees were mostly satisfied with their interaction with other employees, the compatibility between their jobs and abilities and the stability of their jobs; they were mostly unsatisfied with their benefits, retirements and on-the-job training system.As a consequence, the study suggests the following personnel and relevant departments should deliberate relevant supportive measures, provide contract employees with short-term on-the-job training opportunities, and dispatch work with more consideration. Furthermore, unit commanders are encouraged to replace “reprimand” with “encouragement” to the greatest extent in order to enhance the morale of the employees so that their job satisfaction will be increased as well.
