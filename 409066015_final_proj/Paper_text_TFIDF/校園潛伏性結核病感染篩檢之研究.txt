校園潛伏性結核病感染篩檢之研究
Research of Screen for Latent Tuberculosis Infection in Campus

推估結核年感染率
結核病
結核菌素皮膚試驗


本研究係民國92年底嘉義地區某學校發生結核病聚集感染調查事件，為瞭解校園流行狀況及潛伏危機，疾病管制局自民國93年暨94年之3月至4月期間進行校園師生結核菌素試驗。另以問卷調查個人接觸史，藉以探討曾經接觸的危險因子，進一步研究可能遭受感染的原因。分析結果顯示：一、結核菌素試驗反應和學校別、性別、年齡別、卡介苗疤痕數、進出網咖頻率、進出補習班頻率均有差異。二、有疤者其93年與94年試驗反應為陽性人數有因此顯示顯著差異；有重複接種卡介苗及重複測驗所造成的追加效果。三、推估年感染率為2.53-4.11%，較93年國小一年級學童的推估年感染率1.11%高出許多，顯示該年齡群學生存在較高感染風險。四、試驗反應因素特性組合中，以女生、從未進出網咖、有進出補習班、小於等於15-19歲者的組合，是全體人數中陰性反應最多的一群，佔24%。反之，大於15-19歲以上陰性反應者，僅佔2.1%；為潛伏感染較高的一群。五、影響陽性反應之因素，男性的機率是女性的0.88倍、40歲以上者是40歲以下的3.24倍、有疤者是無疤者的1.66倍、進出網咖是不進出的0.90倍、進出補習班是不進出的0.80倍。建議針對測驗反應陽性者5年內定期追蹤發病情形。
The study is a survey of the Tuberculosis (TB) accumulated infection in a campus of Jia-Yi County in 2003. In order to learn about the prevalence and the potential risk of TB in campus, CDC in Taiwan underwent a Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) on teachers and students in the selected campus in March and April of the 2004 and 2005, respectively. Questionnaire on the personal contact history was conducted to take a comprehensive view of the risk contact factors and the infection reasons.The result of analysis revealed 1. The TST status correlates to the factors of schools, gender, age, number of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) scars, frequency of going to Internet-Café and coaching schools. 2. People with scars have different positive reactivity in 1994 &1995. The reason is the boosting effect by double BCG inoculation and TST. 3. Estimates of the annual risk of tuberculous infection (ARTI) are 2.53-4.11%, and this is higher than the result (1.11%) of census on the first grade students in the elementary school in 2004. This shows that they have higher infection risk. 4. The combination of factors of the reactivity to the TST, the female, never going to Internet-Café, going to coaching school, and age≦15-19 years, is the group having the greatest percentage (24%) of the negative reaction. To the contrary, the group that age≧15-19 years, only occupies 2.1% of the negative reaction. As a result, this group has the highest possibility of latent infection. 5. The reactivity prevalence and statistically significant odds ratio (OR) show male (OR =0.88), ≧40 years old (OR =3.24), with BCG (OR =1.66), going to the Internet-Café (OR =0.90), going to the coaching school (OR =0.80). Consequently, it is recommended to take a regular follow-up on people having the TST positive within five years.
