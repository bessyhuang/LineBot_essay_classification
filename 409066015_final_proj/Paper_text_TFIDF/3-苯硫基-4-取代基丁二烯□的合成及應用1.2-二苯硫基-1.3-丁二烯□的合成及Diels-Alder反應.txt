Synthesis and applications of 3-(phenylthio)-4-substituted-3-sublfolenes  = Synthesis and Diels-Alder reactions of 1.2-bis(phenylthio)-1.3-butadiene
The first part of the thesis involve the raction of phenylsulfinate anion with 4-bromo-3-(phenylthio)-2-sulfolene to give a mixture of 4-(phenylsulfonyl)-3-sulfolene. This mixutre upon treatment with one equivalent of n-butyllithium at low temperature followed by the addition of an alkyl halide gave the 4-alky1-4-(phenylsulfonyl)-3-(phenylthio)-2-sulfolenes amalgamj. When two equivalents of n-butyllithium were used, the alkylation proceeded regioselectively to give a mixture of 2-alkyl-3-(phenylsulfonyl)-4-(phenylthio)-3sulfolenes and 5-alkyl-4-(phenylsulfonyl)-3(phenylthio)-2sulfolenes.The intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction of some these products was studied.The second part of the thesis involves the reaction of sodium thiophenoxide reactiontemperatures,times and concentrations. It was found that low temperature,short reaction time, and high concentration of thiophenoxide favored the direct substitution product,3-4bits(phenylthio)-3-sulfoolene,whereas high temperature,long reaction time,and low concentration of thiophenoxide foavored the product with allylic rearrangement,2,3-bis(phenylthio)-2-sulfolene. Extrusion of sulfur dioxide from the latter compound under different conditions gave(E)-and  or (Z)-1,2-bis(phenylthio)-1,3-butadiene. The Diels-Alder reaction of these two stereoisomers was studied.
