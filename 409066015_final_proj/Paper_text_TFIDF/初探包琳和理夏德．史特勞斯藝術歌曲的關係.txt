初探包琳和理夏德．史特勞斯藝術歌曲的關係
A Study of the Relationship between Pauline de Ahna (-Strauss) and Richard Strauss’s Lieder
理夏德．史特勞斯、包琳、女高音、藝術歌曲

理夏德‧史特勞斯一生創作兩百多首藝術歌曲，其中部份與他的妻子包琳有關。包琳是一位女高音，她和史特勞斯藝術歌曲的關係主要反應在史特勞斯創作歌曲的時間和音樂的特色上。從兩人在1894年結婚起，史特勞斯便為包琳譜寫新曲，1897年兩人的兒子出生後至1906年包琳不再演唱為止，史特勞斯更為了他與包琳的音樂會不僅譜寫新曲，也將原有的鋼琴伴奏歌曲改編為管弦樂版本。這些與包琳相關的藝術歌曲透露了包琳的聲音與表演的能力，也透露出詮釋這些作品的方向。本文選擇四首史特勞斯獻給包琳的歌曲和四首包琳喜歡唱的史特勞斯歌曲作為例子。音樂分析與和包琳相關的評論，都顯示包琳在演唱方面擅長表現朗誦式的唸唱，戲劇張力大的片段，綿長的樂句等等。本文章希望藉此初探提供詮釋史特勞斯藝術歌曲的另一個可能性。
Richard Strauss wrote over two hundred art songs (Lieder). Some of them are related to his wife, Pauline. Pauline was a soprano. The relationship between Pauline and Strauss’s Lieder is mainly shown in compositional time and musical characteristics of these songs. Strauss began to write songs for Pauline since their marriage in 1894. From 1897 when their son was born to 1906 when Pauline retired, Strauss not only wrote new songs but also orchestrated songs of piano version for their concerts. These Lieder related to Pauline reveal Pauline’s voice and her performance capability as well as the direction of interpretation. Four songs written for Pauline and four songs Pauline liked to sing are chosen as examples. Both musical analysis and critics on Pauline show that Pauline was good at doing recitative-like recitation, dramatic passage, long phrase...etc. Issues are explored in this article in order to provide another possibility to interpret Strauss’s Lieder.
