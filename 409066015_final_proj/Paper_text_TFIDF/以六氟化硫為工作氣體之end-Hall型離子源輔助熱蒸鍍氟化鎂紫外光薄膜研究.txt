以六氟化硫為工作氣體之end-Hall型離子源輔助熱蒸鍍氟化鎂紫外光薄膜研究
UV Research of End-Hall IAD with MgF2 film using SF6 as working gas
IAD、MgF2、六氟化硫、穿透率、XPS
傳統上利用離子輔助蒸鍍MgF2 (ion-beam assisted deposition, IAD)都會使用氬氣(Ar)做為工作氣體，作為增加薄膜蒸鍍時的能量以改善膜層品質。然而在蒸鍍過程中，往往會有氟的喪失，造成鍍出來的不是純氟化鎂。因此我們嘗試使用六氟化硫(Sulfur hexafluoride, SF6)做為工作氣體，它有著和氬氣一樣惰性氣體的優點，另外由於本身離子態所產生F-可增加MgF2之膜質純度，進而增加膜層穿透率。之後使用XPS(X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer)去分析薄膜的表面成分，測量是否有其他雜質(如MgO、C-F…等)的形成，並且也可以知道SF6與Ar在做為工作氣體時對膜質成份的影響。
Traditionally Ar is used as a working gas to grow MgF2 thin film in IAD (ion-beam assisted deposition) process to increase the energies of deposited species such that the film quality is improved.  However, there is always a loss of F- ions during the process which results in other impurities appeared in MgF2 films. In this study, SF6 (Sulfur hexafluoride) is used as a working gas which provides additional advantage than using noble gas (such as Ar) since more F- ions can be created from the dissociation of SF6 carrying gas in IAD process. Consequently, new MgF2 film will have higher optical transmittance. Later XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) was used to analyze surface compositions to identify other impurities, such as C, O, and Ar, in the film. In addition to the compositions, the chemical bondings of Mg, C, F and O in the film are also obtained from XPS spectra. The results demonstrate that the chemical bonds in the film are closely related to the film growth processes.
