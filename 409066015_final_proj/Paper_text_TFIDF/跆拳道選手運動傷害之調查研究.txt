跆拳道選手運動傷害之調查研究
A study of sports injurie among Taekwondo athletes
跆拳道、運動傷害、求醫行為

摘要1973年5月28日頒布實施的跆拳道競賽規則，至2005年4月12日止已陸陸續續進行十一次的修訂。在新的計分系統下，直接激勵選手攻擊的意識與提高動作的難度，在連續攻擊與近身互擊次數增加的情況下，跆拳道運動傷害發生的情況將更勝於以往。近年來跆拳道的相關研究，主要是以提昇運動員競技實力為主題，包含規則改變後技戰術的比較與生、心理層面的探討以及基本動作運動學分析等，但鮮少針對跆拳道運動傷害作深入的研究。因此，本研究以94年全國運動會跆拳道項目的304名參賽選手為研究對象，利用問卷調查的方式，來瞭解跆拳道運動傷害的分佈以及運動傷害後的處理情形與治療之行為，以供日後教練以及選手之參考。其結果如下：一、跆拳道選手運動傷害分佈情況（一）發生運動傷害的時機，於練習時發生傷害的比率為最高，佔50.9％。（二）發生運動傷害的原因以舊傷復發（22.5％）與互擊（22.0）為最主要原因。（三）造成運動傷害機會最高的動作為旋踢（74.3％）；後踢為次之（7.8％）。（四）運動傷害的部位，依序為腳背（38.5％）;腳踝（25.7％）次之。下半身的受傷比例明顯高於上半身的情況（上肢佔5.0％以及下肢佔89.4％）。（五）運動傷害的類型，是以挫傷（39.9％）、扭傷（36.2％）以及拉傷（11.5％）為主。二、跆拳道選手運動傷害後處理之分佈情形（一）運動傷害受傷第一時間處理方式，有85.8％的選手會選擇以冰敷的方式來處理。（二）運動傷害後尋求中醫治療者為最多（39.0％）；第二是尋求國術師的治療（22.9％）；第三則為西醫（20.2％）。（三）尋醫對象裡排第ㄧ順位之主要原因比率中，有認識的醫師或醫務人員者最多（25.2％）；自身看醫經驗次之（19.3％）。三、跆拳道選手運動傷害後治療情形（一）受傷部位是否有疼痛感部份，以偶爾仍有疼痛感者最多（69.7％）；天天感到疼痛次之（19.7％）。（二）是否持續治療方面，目前以持續治療者最多（60.1％）；沒有持續治療者次之（39.4％）。（三）選手在同ㄧ受傷部位以前是否亦曾受過傷，以兩次以上最多（75.7％）；ㄧ次受過傷的次之（15.1％）。（四）未復原期間持續運動的原因，以自我要求最多（50.5％）；其次為受傷情況不嚴重（33.5％）。（五）受傷後恢復運動的時間，以ㄧ週為最多，佔29.8％，沒有休息次之（24.8％）。四、跆拳道運動傷害後尋醫對象選擇因素分析研究結果發現，尋醫對象並不會受性別、母親教育程度以及家庭收入的高低等因素所影響，但是會受到父親教育程度的影響；另外，尋醫對象也會受到尋醫理由的影響。
ABSTRACTThe Taekwondo competition rules proclaimed on May 28th 1973 had been altered for 11 times by April 12th 2005. The new score system motivates athletes to attack and lift the difficulty of motions, so that there are more sports injuries happened in Taekwondo under the situation of increases on continuous and close attacks .    Most of recent related researches in Taekwondo were within the subject about reinforcing athlete competitiveness, including the comparison of tactics with changed rules, the discussion of both physical and mental factors, and the kinematics analysis of basic motions. But there were less deep researches into the sports injuries in Taekwondo. Therefore, this research aimed to discover the range, treatments, and cures for sports injuries in Taekwondo with surveys to 304 athletes in 2005 National Games as samples. The result showed1. The range of sports injuries in Taekwondo (1) Most of sports injuries occurred during practice and train hours (50.9%). (2) Most of sports injuries occurred because of former injuries (22.5%) and mutual hits (22.0%). (3) Most of sports injuries occurred from roundhouse kicks(74.3%), followed by back-kicks(7.8%). (4) The instep was the most commonly injured region (38.5%), followed by the ankle injuries (25.7%). And the ratio of injuries to lower bodies (89.4%) was obviously higher than upper bodies (5.0%). (5) The contusion was the most commonly injured type (39.9％), followed by the sprain (36.2％) and the pull (11.5％).2. Treatments for sports injuries in Taekwondo (1) The treatment that most of the athletes used when an injury occurred was ice packing (85.8%). (2) For the medical seeking treatment, most of the athletes would seek for eastern medical treatment (39.0%), followed by therapist (22.9%) and western treatment (20.2%). (3) The factor that influenced mostly athletes’ decisions of seeking medical treatment was from those doctors and nurses met before (25.2%), followed by self experience (19.3%).3. Cures for sports injuries in Taekwondo (1) Most of athletes injured before sometimes felt the pain (69.7%), followed by everyday ones (19.7%). (2) Most of athletes injured before continued seeking cures (60.1%), followed by ones without continuing seeking cures (39.4%). (3) Most of athletes injured before had the same injury occurred more than twice (75.7%), followed by once (15.1%). (4) Most of athletes injured continued doing exercise because of self demands (50.5%), followed by not serious situations (33.5%). (5) Most of athletes injured started to do exercise after 1 week (29.8%), followed by ones without a rest (24.8%).4. The analysis of factors that influenced athletes’ decisions of objects of medical treatment to sports injuries in Taekwondo  The result showed that athletes’ decisions would not influenced by gender, mother’s education, and family income, but by father’s education and the reason for medical treatment.
