The effect of relaxation on the release of acute pain and state anxiety in postoperation patients in surgical intensive care units
鬆弛訓練、術後疼痛、焦慮、加護病房
本研究目的在探討鬆弛訓練對緩解外科加護病房術後病患急性疼痛及焦慮的成效，並瞭解鬆弛訓練對外科加護病房病患生理指標及住院滿意度的影響。本研究以立意取樣方式選取90位台北巿某醫學中心外科加護病房術後病患，並隨機分配至介入組(45位)和對照組(45位)。介入組患者於術後第一天開始，接受每日兩次的鬆弛訓練，對照組則只給予常規的護理處置。資料收集以結構式問卷進行訪談，研究工具包括視覺疼痛量表、醫院焦慮量表，以及住院滿意度量表。所得資料以描述性統計、配對T檢定，以及GEE進行分析。本研究結果顯示如下1.  加護病房患者的疼痛程度介於中度至重度疼痛。87.8%的疼痛是因手術傷口所致。疼痛會因為呼吸、咳嗽及移動身體而更加嚴重。2.  在介入措施前，介入組與對照組的最痛程度並無顯著差異(6.60±2.21 vs. 6.67±2.72)；兩組的平均疼痛亦無顯著不同(3.84±2.68 vs. 3.84±2.77)。而在介入措施後患者轉出加護病房時，兩組患者的疼痛程度均有減輕。然而，介入組與對照組患者的最痛程度(4.69±2.53 vs. 3.97±2.60)，和平均疼痛程度(1.84±2.03 vs. 1.33±2.29)均無顯著差異。因此鬆弛訓練對外科加護病房術後患者的緩解疼痛並無顯著效果。3.  在介入措施前，介入組和對照組患者的焦慮程度屬於輕度焦慮(8.18±5.00 v.s. 6.96±3.66)。而兩組患者的焦慮程度在介入措施後患者轉出ICU時均有減輕(4.18±3.46 v.s. 4.64±3.92)，並且兩組患者焦慮減輕的程度具有統計上的顯著差異，因此鬆弛訓練能有效降低外科加護病房術後患者的焦慮程度。4.  介入組患者的住院滿意度雖然高於對照組，但並未達到統計上的顯著意義。5.  鬆弛訓練可有效地降低外科加護病房術後患者的收縮壓達2.26mmHg (P<0.05)，並能提升患者的指溫0.71。C(P<0.001)。本研究證實鬆弛訓練可有效降低外科加護病房病患之焦慮程度。建議針對加護病房處理外科手術後病患的焦慮問題上，可藉肌肉鬆弛訓練，輔以播放輕柔的音樂，經病患自主性等長性肢體活動，運用調和呼吸的方法，增加自我控制能力，轉移病患焦躁的情緒，降低病患的焦慮程度。藉由此研究之結果可提供臨床護理人員參考，增加鬆弛訓練之相關專業知識與技能，並運用於臨床照護上，以提昇臨床照護品質。
The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the effect of relaxation training on the release of acute pain and anxiety in post-operative patients in surgical intensive care units (ICU), and to understand the influence of relaxation on patients’ physical status and their hospitalized satisfaction.The convenience samples of 90 postoperative patients were recruited from the surgical ICU of a large medical center in North Taiwan. Subjects were randomized divided into two groups 45 patients in the intervention group and the other 45 patients in the control group. Patients in the intervention group received the relaxation training twice a day, while patients in the control group received only routine nursing care. Data were collected by interview using a structured questionnaire including demographic data, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) - anxiety subscale, and the Hospitalized Satisfaction Scale. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired t-test, and generalized equation estimate (GEE).Results of this study included1.  Patients suffered from moderate to severe degree of pain. Most of pain was caused by surgical wound. The level of pain was worsen by breathing, coughing, and moving body.2.  On the baseline data, there was no significant difference between the intervention group and the control group on the highest pain of a day (6.60±2.21 vs. 6.67±2.72) as well as in the average pain of a day (3.84±2.68 vs. 3.84±2.77). On the day of patients transferred out of ICU, the level of pain on both groups was decreased. However, there was no significant difference between both groups on the highest pain of a day (4.69±2.53 vs. 3.97±2.60) as well as on the average pain of a day (1.84±2.03 vs. 1.33±2.29). Thus, the relaxation training has no significant effect on reducing pain of postoperative patients in surgical ICU.3.  On the baseline data, both the intervention group and the control group had mild degree of anxiety (8.18±5.00 vs. 6.96±3.66). The intensity of anxiety on both groups was decreased on the day of patients transferred out of ICU (4.18±3.46 vs. 4.64±3.92). In additions, there was significant difference between both groups on the degree of reducing pain. Thus, the relaxation training had significant effect on reducing anxiety of postoperative patients in surgical ICU.4.  The hospitalized satisfaction score in the intervention group was higher than the control group. However, there was no significant difference between two groups.5.  The relaxation training contributed to the change of patients’ physical status by reducing systolic blood pressure 2.26 mmHg (p<0.05) and increasing finger’s temperature 0.71oC(p<0.001).This study confirmed that relaxation training had significant effect on reducing anxiety in postoperative patients in surgical ICU. It is suggested that relaxation could be performed to manage patients’ anxiety in ICU. Nurses should enhance their knowledge on relaxation for better quality of nursing care focusing on patients’ psychological needs.
