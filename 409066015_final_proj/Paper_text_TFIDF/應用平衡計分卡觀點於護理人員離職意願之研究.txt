平衡計分卡、離職意願、護理人員

醫療保健與照護環境改變，醫院面臨的問題愈來愈複雜，而護理人力短缺，且人員流動率、離職率高，為了解護理人員流動問題。研究目的以平衡計分卡觀點，依護理人員離職意願特性，建構財務構面、顧客構面、內部流程構面及學習與成長構面的重要衡量指標，不同構面在離職意願程度上有所不同，作為護理人員在離職及留任之重要指標。研究採用問卷調查方式，研究對象為北部四家醫院之臨床護理人員。經由研究結果發現，以平衡計分卡構面建立護理人員離職意願的指標項目，並建立各構面之指標因素。在離職意願程度愈高時，對內部流程、財務及顧客構面均不認同，而留任意願程度愈低。在護理行政管理上，能了解影響護理人員離職意願之相關因素，以建立有效留任之改善機制，並提高留職率及降低人員流動率，以進而提升護理服務品質及績效。
