零售業採購績效評估系統之研究－以國內某量販店為例
Research of Retailer Buying Performance Evaluation – A Case Study of a Hyper Store
零售業、採購、績效評估

國人的生活習慣，由過去在傳統市場採買的消費模式，逐漸轉變為在大賣場一次性、低價與大量的購買行為，大賣場透過商品的銷售來聯繫供應商與顧客的關係，並於其中獲得利潤。而在大賣場中由商品採購部門管理所有的商品與採購，包含商品採購成本、銷售價格、供應商管理等，但由於商品採購的複雜度高、影響的因素多，且必須隨時配合市場上的訊息作立即性的反映，因此難以有效的提供採購部門一套標準工作流程可予以長期執行。本研究依據產業概況、一般採購績效評估及供應商績效評估等基礎，並採用平衡計分法的架構，建立了完整採購績效評估模型，此模型共分作財務、供應商、商品、顧客、流程、學習與成長等六大構面，並建立各主要構面完整且分層的評估指標。如何將採購績效模型使用在實際公司經營上，為此研究的目的；本研究提供了個案公司操作績效模型的完整步驟，個案公司採購部門可以依據此步驟建立績效評估模型，執行績效評估並進行部門績效的改善。
Taiwan Customers changed their daily shopping behavior from traditional market to hyper, which can be easy to shop in one stop, cheap and big volume. Retailers link customers to suppliers and get the profits by product selling. Buying department handles the product arrangement in retailer, including cost, price, and suppliers. Because the buying procedure full of marketing information and different factors is very complicated, it is difficult to be evaluated by a standard model.The thesis, which is based on retailer feature, buying performance, supplier’s evaluation and balance scored card, build up a complete retailer buying performance index model. It combines six major fields, which are financial, supplier, product, customer, procedure, learning and growth, and all indexes in each major field hierarchically.The target of the research is to put the model into real business. It provides retail companies the procedure to handle performance evaluation, and then retailer buying department can build up the model, evaluate itself and improve their performance based on it.
