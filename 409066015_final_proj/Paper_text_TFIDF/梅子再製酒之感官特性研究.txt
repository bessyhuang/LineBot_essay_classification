梅子再製酒之感官特性研究
Studies on Sensory Attributes in Mei Liqueur
梅子再製酒、描述分析、消費者喜好性品評、主成分分析
梅子由於酸度高、甜度低，很少直接食用，常經加工製成如蜜餞、梅酒等產品。但梅子pH值低，不利於酵母生長，較不易以發酵的方式製成釀造酒。傳統梅酒是採浸漬方式製造，利用酒精將梅子之香氣及可溶性物質萃出而成，屬於再製酒。然而梅子的成熟度、酒精濃度、固液比、糖的添加量、浸漬時間與熟成時間等，對梅子再製酒的品質與風味影響甚大，導致市售的梅子再製酒品質參差不齊。本研究主要在探討梅子再製酒之感官特性，以建立梅子再製酒之品評評分單，用以評估市售梅子再製酒之感官品質。由市售梅子再製酒之基本成分分析，配合感官品評之描述分析，找出影響梅子再製酒品質的主要感官特性；並利用消費者喜好性品評，評估消費者所喜好的梅子再製酒特性。    研究發現，十五種市售梅子再製酒之pH值2.87~3.50，可滴定酸含量為0.39~2.22 g/100mL，總糖含量為6.45~36.96 g/100mL，糖酸比為6.55~39.35，總酚含量為172.43~612.21 mg/L，酒精度為9.3~31.7 %vol，甲醇含量介於29.7~197.5 mg/L， Hunter L值63.4~85.5，Hunter a值0.2~14.6，Hunter b值12.6~36.4，褐變指標0.173~1.566，澄清度為79.1~98.1 ％。可見市售梅子再製酒之基本成分差異甚大。    六位經過篩選、訓練之品評員利用描述分析由市售梅子再製酒找出十九個感官描述語，分別為外觀（色度、澄清度）、香氣（果香味、杏仁味、酒精味、米酒味、糖漬味）、嚐味（酸味、甜味、苦味、鹹味）、風味（果香味、杏仁味、酒精味、米酒味、糖漬味）與口感（刺激感、酒體、澀味）。經相關性分析，杏仁、果香、糖漬之香氣和風味彼此呈正相關（p＜0.05）；苦味、酒精風味、刺激感和澀味亦彼此呈正相關（p＜0.05）。    主成分分析（principal component analysis, PCA）結果顯示，前兩個主成分分別可解釋62.0 ％與16.7 ％之變異。其中刺激感、澀味、酒精風味、甜味以及杏仁、果香、糖漬之香氣與風味與第一主成分具較大之相關性（| r |＞0.807）；澄清度、酸味和酒體與第二主成分呈較大相關（| r |＞0.700）。可見香氣與風味為影響梅子再製酒品質之主要因素，進而依主成分分析結果繪製二十分制品評單。    消費者喜好性品評結果顯示，香氣為影響消費者喜好梅子再製酒之主要特性。依二十分制品評單所評定之品質優良的梅子再製酒亦符合消費者的喜好，故此二十分制品評單能做為一套梅子再製酒感官品質評估的標準。
Mei fruit is seldom consumed directly due to its great sour and low sweet taste, thus this fruit is typically used for processing, such as preserves or mei wine. Mei fruit is not easy to process fermented wine because of its low pH value may inhibit the growth of yeasts. Conventional mei wine is characterized as liqueur product, which is made by alcohol infusion, that alcohol is used to extract aroma and soluble substance from mei. However, maturity of fruit, concentration of alcohol, solid-liquid ratio, sugar content, and infusion and aging time affect quality and flavor of the mei liqueurs significantly, those lead to an inconsistence in the quality of commercial mei liqueurs. The aims of this study focused on determination of sensory attributes of mei liqueurs, and development of a sensory evaluation form for mei liqueurs to differentiate commercial mei liqueurs. Analysis of the basic components of commercial mei liqueurs, evaluation of the main sensory attributes by descriptive analysis, and determination of the key attributes based on consumer preference test were also taken into account.  Results from composition analysis showed the pH value among fifteen commercial mei liqueurs content ranged 2.87~3.50; the concentration of titratable acidity averaged 0.39~2.22 g/100mL; the total sugar contents were 6.45~36.96 g/100mL; the sugar-acid ratio ranged 6.55~39.35; the total phenol contents were 172.43~612.21 mg/L; the content of alcohol ranged 9.3~31.7 %vol; the content of methanol ranged 29.7~197.5 mg/L; the Hunter L, a and b values ranged 63.4~85.5, 0.2~14.6, and 12.6~36.4, respectively; the browning index ranged 0.173~1.566, and the clarity ranged 79.1~98.1 %. The contents of basic components differ greatly among these commercial mei liqueurs.  Six panelists were selected and trained, and those who conducted to characterize nineteen sensory attributes of commercial mei liqueurs by descriptive analysis, including appearance (tint, clarity), aroma (almond, fruity, alcoholic, rice wine, syrupy), taste (sour, sweet, bitter, salty), flavor (almond, fruity, alcoholic, rice wine, syrupy), and texture/mouthfeel (pungency, body, astringency). Correlation analysis was then achieved to determine the relationships among the attributes. The positive correlation （p＜0.05）was obtained between aromas/flavors of almond, fruity, and syrupy. Positive correlation （p＜0.05） was also observed between bitter taste, alcoholic flavor, pungency and astringency.  Results of principal component analysis (PCA) for ten mei liqueurs revealed that the first two principal components accounted for 62.0 % and 16.7 % of the variance, respectively. The first PC was found with high  correlations (| r |＞0.807) between pungency, astringency, alcoholic flavor, sweet, and the aromas/flavors of almond, fruity, and syrupy. The second PC had a higher correlation (| r |＞0.700) in clarity, sour taste and body. The aroma and flavor characteristics were the main factors influencing the quality of commercial mei liqueurs. Subsequently, a 20-point sensory evaluation form was established according to the PCA in this study.  The results of consumer preference test showed that aroma was the main attribute determining consumers’ preferences for mei liqueurs. The high quality mei liqueurs based on the 20-point sensory evaluation was found corresponding with consumers’ preferences, therefore, this 20-point sensory evaluation form should be beneficial to standardize commercial mei liqueur grading.
