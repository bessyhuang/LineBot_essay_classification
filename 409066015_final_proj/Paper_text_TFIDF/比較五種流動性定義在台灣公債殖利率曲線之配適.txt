比較五種流動性定義在台灣公債殖利率曲線之配適
To Compare the Fitness of Five Definitions of Liquidity Applied in the Yield Curve of Taiwanese Government Bond Market
殖利率曲線、流動性、B-Spline模型
台灣與印度等新興公債市場之冷熱門公債交易量的差距很大，K.V. Subramanian以加入流動性考量的B-Slpine模型配適印度公債殖利率曲線，其配適效果優於未考慮流動性的模型。本研究除沿用Subramanian之流動性目標加權函數，並將流動性的衡量方法由原先的一種擴增至五種，再比較這五種不同定義之流動性衡量在B-Spline模型與加入存續期間倒數為權重的B-Spline修正模型的配適表現。實證結果顯示，無論是B-Spline基本模型或B-Spline修正模型，採用公債交易量之平方根作為流動性衡量基準，其實證結果與配適能力皆有不錯的表現，應為合理可行的方法之一。
In emerging bond market, like Taiwanese and Indian government bond market are aniso-liquid bond markets. K.V. Subramanian added liquidity constraint to B-Spline model when fitting the yield curve of Indian government bond market,the performance of fitting was better than the B-Spline model without liquidity constraint . This paper uses Subramanian’s liquidity-weighted objective function and augments four other methods about the measure of liquidity.To compare fitting performance of the B-Spline model and modified B-Spline model with five liquidity-weighted objective functions . The empiric findings of this study are as follow  Both the B-Spline model and modified B-Spline model which use the liquidity benchmark with the square root of trading volume are better than those models which use other functions in fitting performance.So, this is a feasible and suitable method to estimate the yield curve of the Taiwanese Government Bond market.
