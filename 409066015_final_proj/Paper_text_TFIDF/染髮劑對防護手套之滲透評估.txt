防護手套

胺基苯酚﹙aminophenol﹚、苯二胺﹙phenylenediamine﹚及其同分異構物﹙isomers﹚為染髮劑中的顯色成分，亦是造成接觸性皮膚炎之主要危害物質。以ASTM F739之標準滲透測試方法測試市售2種染髮劑﹙B染髮劑-自然黑色與F染髮劑-紅銅棕色﹚中之對苯二胺及胺基苯酚之鄰、間、對異構物挑戰3種手套(A手套-染劑附贈手套、B手套-拋棄式乳膠[latex]手套及C手套-丁腈橡膠[nitrile]手套)之滲透性。利用滲透測試結果，評估染髮時所使用之防護手套能否有效隔離染髮劑中之胺基苯酚、苯二胺及其同分異構物，以降低可能的皮膚暴露。    滲透結果顯示，B染髮劑挑戰A手套之最短破出時間﹙breakthrough time, tb﹚與延滯時間(lag time, tl)為鄰胺基苯酚，分別為70~80分鐘與73~83分鐘，B染髮劑挑戰B手套最短破出時間與延滯時間為對苯二胺，分別為250~300分鐘與250~301分鐘；F染髮劑挑戰A手套最短破出時間與延滯時間為對胺基苯酚，皆為200~280分鐘。而C手套則無任何可偵測之滲透發生。如以破出時間為防護效率之考量，則A手套應可提供1小時的保護，B手套為3小時，C手套可重複使用6天，每天使用6小時。因此建議美髮業者在進行長時間的染髮作業時，可穿戴丁腈橡膠材質之手套以減低可能的皮膚暴露。    B染髮劑挑戰A手套之結果以鄰胺基苯酚之穩定滲透速率與擴散係數最大，分別為5.26±0.42 μg min-cm2與0.23±0.02 10-4mm2 min。B染髮劑對B手套最大之穩定滲透速率與擴散係數亦為鄰胺基苯酚，分別為1.72±0.00 μg min-cm2與0.17±0.00 10-4mm2 min。F染髮劑挑戰A手套最大之穩定滲透速率與擴散係數則為對胺基苯酚，分別為1.02±0.18 μg min-cm2與0.12±0.05 10-4mm2 min。    迴歸分析結果顯示，B染髮劑挑戰A手套之破出時間、延滯時間分別皆與擴散係數及logkow呈現負相關(p<0.05)。穩定滲透速率(SSPR)與莫耳體積(MV)呈現負相關，與擴散係數及logkow呈現正相關。因此影響破出時間及延滯時間的主要因素為擴散係數及分子的極性(logkow)，而影響穩定滲透速率的因素為擴散係數、分子大小(MV)及極性。
Aminophenol, phenylenediamine, and their isomers are the color-changed ingredients of hair dyes. Nevertheless they are the main hazardous chemicals causing contact dermatitis. The ASTM F739 standard permeation test method was applied to investigate the permeation of the para- meta-, and ortho- isomers of aminophenol and p-phenylenedimine in two different commercially available hair dyes(code B- natural black and code F-mahogany copper brown ). Three different glove materials were tested (Glove A - gloves included in the hair-dye packages, Glove B - latex gloves, and Glove C - nitrile gloves). The permeation results of these chemicals were utilized to evaluate the protective efficiencies of the 3 tested gloves. The appropriate gloves were recommended to prevent the dermal exposure of hair dyes.The o-aminophenol in code B hair dye resulted in the shortest breakthrough time (tb = 70 ~ 80 min) and lag time (tl = 73 ~ 83 min) while challenged with glove A. With glove B, the earliest breakthrough of code B hair dye was p-phenylenediamine with tb = 250 ~300 min and tl = 250 ~301 min. The other hair dye - code F challenged with Glove A showed o-aminophenol permeated first with the breakthrough time (tb = 200 ~ 280 min) and lag time (tl = 200 ~ 280 min). No breakthrough was detected for Glove C. According to the results of the breakthrough times and lag times, these three gloves provide different protection durations – 1 hour for Glove A, 3 hours for Glove B, and 6 days for Glove C with daily use of 6 hours. Therefore, nitrile gloves (Glove C) are recommended for long-time handling of these hair dyes to prevent dermal exposure.The o-aminophenol was the one with the fastest steady state permeation (SSPR) and the largest diffusion coefficient (D) among all tested conditions in this study. The fastest SSPR was 5.260.42 μg min-cm2and the highest D was 0.230.02 10-4mm2 min for code B hair dye with Glove A. This suggested that the exposure dose of o-aminophenol might also be higher than other tested chemicals once the permeation initiated.The regression analyses showed that breakthrough time (tb) was inversely correlated with diffusion coefficient (D) or the logKow for code B hair dye with Glove A significantly (p<0.05). Similar correlations were also found for lag time (tl) for the same challenged condition. The steady state permeation rate (SSPR) was affected by molar volume (MV) inversely and diffusion coefficient (D) or logKow positively. At least, two independent variables are necessary to account for the SSPR of the complex mixture, code B hair dye for the gloves in the hair dye package. One factor accounts for molecular size and the other for diffusion behavior or polarity.
