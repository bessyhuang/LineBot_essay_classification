動能投資策略在台灣股市之應用
The application of the momentum strategy in Taiwan stock market
交易策略、動能投資、月交易資料、交易成本
本文參考Jegadeesh and Timan(1993)和Lee and Swaminathan (2000)的方法，建立贏家與輸家的投資組合，以建構台灣股市短期至中長期之報酬率與週轉率交易策略，並研究計入交易成本的多重套利交易策略的績效。發現以報酬率為建立贏家與輸家的基礎所建構投資策略投資，在短期可得到顯著為正的月平均報酬，短期策略以買贏家賣輸家的方式，可以降低投資績效的波動性，使考量風險後的報酬相對大盤指數為佳；而以週轉率為基礎所建構投資策略，則有約50%獲得正報酬，但統計檢定結果不顯著。二維動能投資策略方面，報酬率動能投資策略在高週轉率獲得正報酬的機率較在低週轉率時高，但統計檢定上並不顯著。週轉率投資策略在輸家組合及贏家組合時，幾乎所有投資策略有正的報酬，但均不顯著。動能生命週期策略顯示，台灣股票市場早期動能投資策略的投資績效比晚期動能投資策略為佳。而在計入手續費、交易稅等固定交易成本之後，所有投資策略月平均報酬都出現明顯下降的情形。
This is a study on the construction of a short to medium term trading strategy for the stocks listed in the Taiwan Stock market mainly based on the methods of Jegadeesh & Timan(1993) and Lee & Swaminathan(2000).This study finds winner and loser by return and turnover rate to study the performance of the strategy and that after fixed cost. The result shows that when using short-term strategy, the portfolio based on the return trading strategy model can yield higher return and have lower volatility of investment performance relative to benchmark. The probability for the portfolios based on the turnover rate trading strategy model to have positive returns is around 50%, while not significant in the t-test. For the two-dimension momentum strategy, the portfolios yield positive return only in the short term when fixed in lower turnover rate. When fixed in higher turnover rate, mostly it can yield positive returns, but not really evident with the t-test. The turnover rate strategy produces positive returns whether fixed in the loser or the winner, but it’s not really evident with the t-test as well. The study of life cycle momentum shows that the performance of early stage strategy is better than late stage strategy in the Taiwan stock market. Lastly, the study shows that cost of trade e.g. both the tax and the brokerage fees has a significant negative impact on the return of the portfolio.
