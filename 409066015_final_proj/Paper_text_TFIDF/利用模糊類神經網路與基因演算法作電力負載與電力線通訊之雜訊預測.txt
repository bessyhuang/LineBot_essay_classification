電力負載預測、電力線通訊、雜訊
電力負載預測在電力公司規劃未來的電力供給時，為不可或缺的考量因素之一，且於電力能源運用廣泛的現在，若能準確的預測電力負載之消耗，不但可減少電力公司運作維修的成本，並可增強電力系統供電的可靠度，避免因為供電不足造成用戶的損失與不便，增加營運的競爭力。而在科技爆炸的時代，電力線已經不只是傳輸電力的媒介，而是成為傳輸資料的網路媒介，藉由普及的電力線網路，改善電信網路到用戶間之最後一哩（Last mile）的問題，而由於電力線網路之特性，易因連結的電器不同導致阻抗的變動，及訊號衰減與內外部的干擾問題，進而影響到資料傳輸的正確性，因此雜訊在電力線網路通訊應用上則是不可忽視的問題。本文旨在使用類神經網路、模糊理論與實數型基因演算法等理論來預測電力負載與電力線雜訊，利用MATLAB程式來訓練與建立模擬類神經網路之相關模型，並實際量測電力負載與電力線雜訊，期望模擬出之結果能對電力負載預測（Forecasting）與電力線雜訊偵測（Prediction）往後之研究，能有些許參考價值與貢獻。
Electricity is widely applied in many aspects of modern life. Precise forecasting of electricity consumption may not only reduce operational and maintenance cost for power companies but also enhance the reliability of power systems, as well as avoid shortage of supply that causes damage and inconvenience to customers. The power line was not only transferring the electricity but also to act as the medium of communication. Through the convenient of power line networks which could improve the question of last mile. But the power line would affected by variable impedance, attenuation of distance and interference. Owing to the variably characteristic of power line, the noise question always was an important issue. In this paper, the proposed gradient descent neural network assist with the fuzzy theorem and the reduced form genetic algorithm are adopted to training our forecasting network and model. Those networks are simulated by MATLAB program. And the training data profile is acquired from the home. Through compare those simulation results, would expect to have some contribution in the research field.
