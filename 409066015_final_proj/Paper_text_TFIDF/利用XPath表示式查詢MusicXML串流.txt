利用XPath表示式查詢MusicXML串流
Querying Streaming MusicXML with XPath Expressions
In the research field of music information retrieval, a precise and efficient querying (filtering) system are critical to provide flexible services and applications. Meanwhile, the MusicXML is considered as one of the most popular data format for betterstructured description on music objects. With the emerging streaming data model, we propose an efficient filtering system against streaming MusicXML. User queries are specified in Simplified Music Notation Sequence. Three key issues are investigated in this system, including query notes of crossing measures, polyphonic music query, and the order of query notes. We propose an automaton-based method to efficiently resolve user queries against streaming MusicXML.
